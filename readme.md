Automated Web Application Testing

Automating testing web applications

The Goal of the project is to successfully test the penetration tool built for testing web application vulnerabilities and fetch the data exposed on the web page. 

This tool is developed to test vulnerabilities in the application layer like SQL injection, Cross site scripting etc. 

This tool can be used to penetrate web applications, fetch the data, and can affect the behavior of web applications. For this project, the target application is to test for vulnerabilities is DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application). We can visualize the sequence of events in the browser.

Follow the steps:

- run main.py

- The main program takes the IP address of the application.

- Enter IP address of the machine you want to attack.

- It then requests for an user input to perform specific kind of attack on the web application.

- enter the serial number of the attack.

- A firefox browser will automatically open and you can visualize the sequence of events.
